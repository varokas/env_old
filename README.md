Instant Environment Setup
=========================

Set up a new environment in a flash. 

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/varokas/env ~/.env
    ~/.env/bin/osx 
    ~/.env/bin/run
    ~/.env/bin/post

After install, you need to use Plug to install vi extensions. Use :PlugInstall

Then compile YCM
    cd ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe/
    ./install.sh
